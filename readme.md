# Devops_Sandbox

## Overview
This repository is a comprehensive CI/CD showcase project that demonstrates the integration and automation of multiple technologies to streamline the development, testing, and deployment processes. It features examples using Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, SonarQube, and ArgoCD, applied to Java, Node.js, and Python applications.

## Technologies Used
- **Jenkins**: Automates the build, test, and deployment pipeline.
- **Docker**: Containerizes the applications for consistent environments across different stages of the pipeline.
- **Kubernetes**: Orchestrates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
- **SonarQube**: Provides continuous inspection of code quality and security.
- **ArgoCD**: Manages the deployment of applications using GitOps methodology.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into folders based on the application type and technology stack:

- **Java-Maven-Sonar-Argocd-Helm-K8S**: Contains the source code, Dockerfile, Jenkins pipeline script, Kubernetes manifests, and SonarQube configuration for a sample Java application.
- **Node.js Application**: (To be added) Includes the source code, Dockerfile, Jenkins pipeline script, Kubernetes manifests, and SonarQube configuration for a sample Node.js application.
- **Python Application**: (To be added) Holds the source code, Dockerfile, Jenkins pipeline script, Kubernetes manifests, and SonarQube configuration for a sample Python application.

## Getting Started
To get started with the `Devops_Sandbox` repository:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/sudhanshuku01/Devops_Sandbox.git
   cd Devops_Sandbox
   ```

2. **Set Up Jenkins**:
   - Configure Jenkins to use the provided pipeline scripts for each application.
   - Ensure Jenkins has the necessary plugins installed (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes, SonarQube Scanner).

3. **Build and Test Applications**:
   - Use Jenkins to build and test the applications using Docker containers.
   - Analyze code quality with SonarQube.

4. **Deploy with Kubernetes and ArgoCD**:
   - Deploy the containerized applications to a Kubernetes cluster.
   - Manage deployments using ArgoCD and GitOps principles.
